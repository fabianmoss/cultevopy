Then, we summarize some general ideas about music and cultural evolution. \n\nSubsequently, we follow the excellent learning path for computational models in cultural evolution provided by the book [_Individual-based models of cultural evolution: A step-by-step guide using R_](https://acerbialberto.com/IBM-cultevo/) [@Acerbi2022]. These pages comprise a translation of this resource to Python. Finally, we will review and discuss a number of recent publications on music and cultural evolution in the advanced topics section at the end.\n\n:::{.callout}\nIf you want to refer to this resource, please cite it as appropriately, e.g.: Moss, F. C. (2022). \"Cultural Evolution and Music: Models and Applications in Python\". <https://fabianmoss.github.io/cultevopy>\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nThe material on this page has been adapted and designed for my musicology research seminar \"Music Memes: quantitative approaches and theories of cultural transmission of music\" at [WÃ¼rzburg University](https://uni-wuerzburg.de/), Germany.\n\nNote that the materials here are still under development. Please inform me if you notice any errors or other issues.\n:::\n\n##### Acknowledgements {.appendix}\n\nI am grateful for encouragement from [Alberto Acerbi](https://twitter.com/acerbialberto) to continue working on my Python translation of his book and many helpful comments.\n\n",
