## A model of style in music

A comprehensive model for theoretical treatment of style 
was proposed by @Meyer1989_StyleMusicTheory.
In a nutshell, he proposes a model where certain constraints
favor differnt kinds of patternings. He organises these 
constraints hierarchically so that this model is 
suitable to describe a variety of stylistic phenomena 
on different levels. This clear separation is more conceptual
and practical only for theoretical discussions. In a real scenario,
boundaries are often unclear or ambigous.

### Constraints

1. Laws
2. Rules
3. Strategies

### Patterns

1. Dialect
2. Idiom
3. Intraopus Style (here, we need a concept of "work", but the extended "meme" concept or "memecomplex might also be useful")
