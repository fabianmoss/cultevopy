# Modeling document traditions

<!-- Here, we show how one can use cultural evolution 
methods to model the histories of manuscripts.
This is based on a phylogenetic analysis of a Prelude 
by Orlando Gibbons [@Windram2014_PhylogeneticAnalysisOrlando].

## Context

## Data and coding

## Mutations create new traditions 

## Sequence alignment 

[@Savage2022_SequenceAlignmentFolk]

## Constructing a possible lineage

## Being confident

bootstrapping procedures

## Conclusion

Briefly discuss NeighborNet graph and point to similar approach in 
[@Windram2022_PhylogeneticAnalysisTwo]. -->
