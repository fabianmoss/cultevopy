# Models 

Throughout this book we will use on quantitative models to describe evolutionary processes. A model is a simplyfied description that captures what we know about a phenomenon of interest in terms of variables and their relations to one another. While models in this sense are always reductions of the real-world process being modeled, they have the benefit that all of their parts can be understood. Moreover, formal models usually incorporate one or several _parameters_, that is, variables the value of which is mutable. Changing parameter values thus renders different instances of a model that, in turn, allow one to ask the question "What if?" and to abserve the behavior of simulated processes in the long run. Answering this question under different conditions (different parameter settings) then will allow us to draw inferences from the modeling outcomes to interpret our phenomenon of interest.

It is precisely the ability of formal models to be adapted at will why they form the core part of this book. Starting with simple models with only very few variables, we will gradually make them more complex by including additional variables. However, it will remain our attempt to keep our models as simple as possible. While it is theoretically possible to include any number of variables in modeling, more complex models become harder to understand, and the interactions between the numerous variables more difficult to interpret. 

As mentioned above, the goal of modeling is often to approximate rather than to recreate a process in the world. Sometimes, the goal is rather to show that a real process does _not_ conform to the outcomes of certain modeling assumptions, from which can be deduced that other factors---possibly yet unknown ones---must be taken into account. One of the most common baseline comparison models is the so-called 'neutral model [see, e.g., @Bentley2004_RandomDriftCulture], where cultural traits are randomly copied from previous generations. We will see in @sec-unbiased_transmission what the consequences of this assumption are. 

Questions concerning model comparison---chosing the 'best' model for a problem at hand---or dealing with the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability are central issues in many areas of empirical science, such as machine learning, computational sociology, or cognitive psychology, and many textbooks dedicate some discussion to the topic [e.g. @Bishop2012_ModelbasedMachineLearning; @Farrell2018_ComputationalModelingCognition; @McElreath2020_StatisticalRethinkingBayesian]. For excellent discussions and examples of modeling in music research, see @Honing2006_ComputationalModelingMusica and @Finkensiepforthcoming_MusicTheoryModeldriven.

## A simple example

Models are meant to be abstract representations of 
(some part of) reality. They necessarily need 
to be simpler than reality, simple enough so that we 
can understand them, but close enough to reality so
that they are actually useful to us. 

Why not having more complex models that accurately 
represent reality? Well, first of all that is a 
very difficult endeavour. But, more importantly:

> No model is ever a complete recreation of reality. That would be pointless: we would have replaced a complex, incomprehensible reality with a complex, incomprehensible model. Instead, models are useful because of their simplicity. [@Acerbi2022, Introduction]

So what does that mean in practice? I will try to 
demonstrate this with an admittedly boring but 
hopefully illustrative example. Assume we want to model the entire area of this (fictional) country:

![The outline of a fictional country.](img/fictional_country.png)

Maybe the most simple, albeit naive approach would be to say that the total area of this country can be 
modeled with a square. A square is a very 
parsimonious model: in order to describe its area,
only one parameter is needed, its side length.

![A square.](img/square.png)

What's more, we can even give a precise mathematical
formula for the area of our fictional country under 
the square model:

$$M_1(a) = a^2$$

In Python code, we could express this model as the following function:

```{python}

def square_model(a):
    return a**2
```

Of course, this is not a good model of the 
area of the country. But one of the strengths
of formal models is that they are unquivocal.
There might be situations, in which the rough 
estimate of the square model is actually sufficient 
for our purpose. So why use a more complex model
if the simplest one does the job? 

Most of the time, however, such a simplistic model
will not suffice and we need to invest brain power 
to come up with a better one.^['Better' means here 
that it is closer to the reality we actually want to 
describe, while at the same time being as simple 
as possible. This trade-off is usually called "Occam's razor". Google it!]
The following model is one way to improve upon
our first mode:

![A rectangle.](img/rectangle.png)

The shape of the rectangle seems to fit our 
country's outline better. Hooray!
As for the square model, we do have a mathematical formuly to describe our rectangle model:

$$M_2(a,b) = a \cdot b$$

In Python code:

```{python}
def rectangle(a,b):
    return a * b
```

But this improvement comes at a price:
instead of having only one parameter, `a`,
we now have two, `a` and `b`. 
Our model has instantly become twice as complex!
