  abstract = {Abstract: In recent years, music and musicality have been the focus of an increasing amount of research effort. This has led to a growing role and visibility of the contribution of (bio)musicology to the field of neuroscience and cognitive sciences at large. While it has been widely acknowledged that there are commonalities between speech, language, and musicality, several researchers explain this by considering musicality as an epiphenomenon of language. However, an alternative hypothesis is that musicality is an innate and widely shared capacity for music that can be seen as a natural, spontaneously developing set of traits based on and constrained by our cognitive abilities and their underlying biology. A comparative study of musicality in humans and well‐known animal models (monkeys, birds, pinnipeds) will further our insights on which features of musicality are exclusive to humans and which are shared between humans and nonhuman animals, contribute to an understanding of the musical phenotype, and further constrain existing evolutionary theories of music and musicality.

Drawing on these concepts, Professors Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman classify and systematize the various modes of transmitting "culture" and explore their consequences for cultural evolution. In the process, they develop a mathematical theory of the non-genetic transmission of cultural traits that provides a framework for future investigations in quantitative social and anthropological science. The authors use quantitative models that incorporate the various modes of transmission (for example, parent-child, peer-peer, and teacher-student), and evaluate data from sociology, archaeology, and epidemiology in terms of the models. They show that the various modes of transmission in conjunction with cultural and natural selection produce various rates of cultural evolution and various degrees of diversity within and between groups. The same framework can be used for explaining phenomena as apparently unrelated as linguistics, epidemics, social values and customs, and diffusion of innovations. The authors conclude that cultural transmission is an essential factor in the study of cultural change.},

  abstract = {In musicology, there has been a long debate about a meaningful partitioning and description of music history regarding composition styles. Particularly, concepts of historical periods have been criticized since they cannot account for the continuous and interwoven evolution of style. To systematically study this evolution, large corpora are necessary suggesting the use of computational strategies. This article presents such strategies and experiments relying on a dataset of 2000 audio recordings, which cover more than 300 years of music history. From the recordings, we extract different tonal features. We propose a method to visualize these features over the course of history using evolution curves. With the curves, we re-trace hypotheses concerning the evolution of chord transitions, intervals, and tonal complexity. Furthermore, we perform unsupervised clustering of recordings across composition years, individual pieces, and composers. In these studies, we found independent evidence of historical periods that broadly agrees with traditional views as well as recent data-driven experiments. This shows that computational experiments can provide novel insights into the evolution of styles.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic trees or networks representing cultural evolution are typically built using methods from biology that use similarities and differences in cultural traits to infer the historical relationships between the populations that produced them. While these methods have yielded important insights, researchers continue to debate the extent to which cultural phylogenies are tree-like or reticulated due to high levels of horizontal transmission. In this study, we propose a novel method for phylogenetic reconstruction using dynamic community detection that focuses not on the cultural traits themselves (e.g., musical features), but the people creating them (musicians). We used data from 1,498,483 collaborative relationships between electronic music artists to construct a cultural phylogeny based on observed population structure. The results suggest that, although vertical transmission appears to be dominant, the potential for horizontal transmission (indexed by between-population linkage) is relatively high and populations never become fully isolated from one another. In addition, we found evidence that electronic music diversity has increased between 1975 and 1999. The method used in this study is available as a new R package called DynCommPhylo. Future studies should apply this method to other cultural systems such as academic publishing and film, as well as biological systems where high resolution reproductive data is available, and develop formal inferential models to assess how levels of reticulation in evolution vary across domains.},

Some suggest that scales based on the harmonic series are inherently pleasant, while others propose that scales are chosen that are easy to communicate. However, testing these theories has been hindered by the sparseness of empirical evidence. Here, we assimilate data from diverse ethnomusicological sources into a cross-cultural database of scales. We generate populations of scales based on multiple theories and assess their similarity to empirical distributions from the database. Most scales tend to include intervals which are close in size to perfect fifths (``imperfect fifths''), and packing arguments explain the salient features of the distributions. Scales are also preferred if their intervals are compressible, which may facilitate efficient communication and memory of melodies. While scales appear to evolve according to various selection pressures, the simplest h imperfect-fifths packing model best fits the empirical data.},

With contributions from over fifty experts in the field, the range and depth of coverage is unequalled. All the chapters combine a solid review of the relevant literature with well-reasoned arguments and robust discussions of the major findings, as well as original insights and suggestions for future work. Written by leading experts, the 52 chapters are divided into 11 sections covering both experimental and theoretical perspectives, each edited by an internationally recognised authority Ten sections each present chapters that focus on specific areas of music psychology: - the origins and functions of music - music perception - responses to music - music and the brain - musical development - learning musical skills - musical performance - composition and improvisation - the role of music in our everyday lives - music therapy and conceptual frameworks In each section, expert authors critically review the literature, highlight current issues, and explore possibilities for the future. The final section examines how in recent years the study of music psychology has broadened to include a range of other scientific disciplines. It considers the way that the research has developed in relation to technological advances, fostering links across the field and providing an overview of the areas where the field needs further development in the future. The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology will be the essential reference text for students and researchers across psychology and neuroscience.},

To tackle a new application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we describe an alternative methodology for applying machine learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each new application. The solution is expressed through a compact modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine learning code is then generated automatically. This model-based approach offers several major advantages, including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore, newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms, provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a powerful software environment for model-based machine learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming language called Infer.NET, which has been widely used in practical applications.},

  abstract = {Serial sources such as records, registers, and inventories are the `classic' sources for quantitative history. Unstructured, narrative texts such as newspaper articles or reports were out of reach for historical analyses, both for practical reasons~\textemdash{} availability, time needed for manual processing \textemdash{} and for methodological reasons: manual coding of texts is notoriously difficult and hampered by low inter-coder reliability. The recent availability of large amounts of digitized sources allows for the application of natural language processing, which has the potential to overcome these problems. However, the automatic evaluation of large amounts of texts \textemdash{} and historical texts in particular \textemdash{} for historical research also brings new challenges. First of all, it requires a source criticism that goes beyond the individual source and also considers the corpus as a whole. It is a well-known problem in corpus linguistics to determine the `balancedness' of a corpus, but when analyzing the content of texts rather than `just' the language, determining the `meaningfulness' of a corpus is even more important. Second, automatic analyses require operationalizable descriptions of the information you are looking for. Third, automatically produced results require interpretation, in particular, when \textemdash{} as in history \textemdash{} the ultimate research question is qualitative, not quantitative. This, finally, poses the question, whether the insights gained could inform formal, i.e., machine-processable, models, which could serve as foundation and stepping stones for further research.},

  abstract = {Textual scholars studying the transmission history of literary texts increasingly make use of 'phylogenetic' computer programs from evolutionary biology, which are conventionally used for inferring the evolutionary relationships among organisms from DNA sequence data. However, very little use has been made of phylogenetic methods in studying musical traditions. We have tested the use of the methods in analysing the transmission history of 16 extant sources of the Prelude in G by Orlando Gibbons. Variations in features such as pitch, rhythm and note pattern were recorded as a 'Nexus file', which was analysed using the phylogenetic methods of Maximum Parsimony and NeighborNet. Statistical confidence was tested using bootstrapping. The Maximum Parsimony analysis placed the sources into four groups with strong statistical support and the NeighborNet analysis gave similar results, while indicating a linkage between members of two of the major groups. Separate analyses of passages of running semiquavers and the chordal accompaniment showed that the latter was responsible for most of the phylogenetic structure, consistent with traditional scholarship. The analysis also showed a more fundamental division into two groups, with one containing mostly early to mid-17th century sources and the other containing only more recent ones. The study shows that phylogenetic methods can be used to infer robust conclusions on the transmission history of this tradition that are consistent with conventional scholarship. These novel methods are likely to be of general applicability as a tool for music scholars.},

  abstract = {J. S. Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier II is well known for the complexity of its source situation, and its vast array of variant readings. The current article uses techniques of phylogenetic analysis, developed in the biological sciences, to deepen our understanding of the complex relationships between the primary sources. The computer algorithm NeighborNet is used to analyse data comprising the textual variants for the Prelude in A, bwv888 and the Prelude in C, bwv870. The resultant grouping of sources reflects the differences in revision practice between the two preludes. While Bach saw little need to revise the Prelude in A, the Prelude in C underwent a process of continued revision that can be discerned in the results of the phylogenetic analysis. The analyses also highlight the uncertain relationship of the manuscript DD70 with the other sources of the Prelude in C and the implications for 18th-century performance practice.},

  abstract = {Genes are propagated by error-prone copying, and the resulting variation provides the basis for phylogenetic reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. Horizontal gene transfer may be superimposed on a tree-like evolutionary pattern, with some relationships better depicted as networks. The copying of manuscripts by scribes is very similar to the replication of genes, and phylogenetic inference programs can be used directly for reconstructing the copying history of different versions of a manuscript text. Phylogenetic methods have also been used for some time to analyse the evolution of languages and the development of physical cultural artefacts. These studies can help to answer a range of anthropological questions. We propose the adoption of the term ``phylomemetics'' for phylogenetic analysis of reproducing non-genetic elements.},
