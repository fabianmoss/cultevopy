# Introduction

## The Cultural Evolution of Music

The field of cultural evolution emerged in the 1980's [e.g., @Boyd1985; @Cavalli-Sforza1981_CulturalTransmissionEvolution], 
and has, in parallel with the advancement of computational facilities,
gained momentum. Theories on cultural evolution share many facets with approaches on memetics
[@Aunger2001_DarwinizingCultureStatus;@Dawkins1976_SelfishGenea;@Blackmore2000_MemeMachine],
a field that has also been applied to the case of music [@Jan2016].

In recent years, several approaches have attempted to 
apply formal models from cultural evolution to the domain of music. 

In the present context, we first introduce some central ideas of cultural evolution and review a few major publications for the domain of music.

A few selected important contributions are: 

- "Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach" [@Cavalli-Sforza1981_CulturalTransmissionEvolution]
- "Culture and the Evolutionary Process" [@Boyd1985]
- "The Memetics of Music" [@Jan2016]
- "Cultural Evolution and Music" [@Youngblood2021]
- "Cultural Evolution of Music" [@Savage2019]

## Music in human evolution

This book is about the cultural evolution of music. 
It has to be mentioned, however, that there is a large body of research
on the biological evolution of music. This research asks questions about
with which evolutionary advantages music endowed early humans, 
whether it is something that we share with other animals or whether it makes us unique.
Some hold the view that music has no particularly relevant evolutionary function at all [@Pinker1997_HowMindWorks],
while others see in it a key to our success as a species [@Cross2016_NatureMusicIts].

Whatever the true role of music in the evolutionary history of humanity may have been,
it is most certainly a fascinating topic to reflect upon. After all, 
human musical activity with dedicated instruments can be traced back at least 20,000 years, 
although it seems more than likely that human 'musicking' dates back much further,
since our own bodies and voices already provided us with excellent musical instruments
long before the first instruments have been devised.

If you are interested in learning more about biological-evolutionary aspects 
of music, I highly recommend to read, e.g. @Wallin2001_OriginsMusic, @Morley2013_PrehistoryMusicHuman,
@Tomlinson2018_MillionYearsMusic, and @Honing2018_BiologicalBasisMusicality.

## History and cultural evolution

Documenting, describing, and interpreting changes in human culture 
is what historians do. Accordingly, changes in music belong to the field 
of music history, or historical musicology. 
However, most historians would probably be hesitant to employ 
models, or worse: formal models, in order to describe historical processes.
The dictum "history doesn't repeat itself" seems to raise a fundamental argument
against such endeavors that aim at explaining cultural or historical changes
by means of underlying latent 'forces'. Modeling, in that view, seems to
erroneously assume that history is teleological -- directed towards a predetermined goal.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that there are many aspects of culture exhibit regularities and 'progresses' that are hard to explain if there are no guiding processes. Defining "culture"
is, of course, yet another difficult enterprise. Here, I follow more or less the definition of @Boyd1985 [p. 33]: "Culture is information capable of affecting individuals' phenotypes which they acquire from other conspecifics _by teaching or imitation_ [emphasis mine]".^[I encourage you to read Chapter 3 of their seminal book in order to fully capture the meaning of this quote.] The part important to us here is "by teaching or imitation", which is meant to imply: _not_ by genetic inheritance. If humans can transmit information by other means than genetic inheritance, and if these transmission processes continue over many generations, then they are worth studying. Rest assured, the assumption of a hidden goal towards which all cultural processes are directed is not needed at all! I hope that you will share this conviction after working through this material.

## Models

Throughout this book we will use on quantitative models to describe evolutionary processes. A model is a simplyfied description that captures what we know about a phenomenon of interest in terms of variables and their relations to one another. While models in this sense are always reductions of the real-world process being modeled, they have the benefit that all of their parts can be understood. Moreover, formal models usually incorporate one or several _parameters_, that is, variables the value of which is mutable. Changing parameter values thus renders different instances of a model that, in turn, allow one to ask the question "What if?" and to abserve the behavior of simulated processes in the long run. Answering this question under different conditions (different parameter settings) then will allow us to draw inferences from the modeling outcomes to interpret our phenomenon of interest.

It is precisely the ability of formal models to be adapted at will why they form the core part of this book. Starting with simple models with only very few variables, we will gradually make them more complex by including additional variables. However, it will remain our attempt to keep our models as simple as possible. While it is theoretically possible to include any number of variables in modeling, more complex models become harder to understand, and the interactions between the numerous variables more difficult to interpret. 

As mentioned above, the goal of modeling is often to approximate rather than to recreate a process in the world. Sometimes, the goal is rather to show that a real process does _not_ conform to the outcomes of certain modeling assumptions, from which can be deduced that other factors---possibly yet unknown ones---must be taken into account. One of the most common baseline comparison models is the so-called 'neutral model [see, e.g., @Bentley2004_RandomDriftCulture], where cultural traits are randomly copied from previous generations. We will see in @sec-unbiased_transmission what the consequences of this assumption are. 

Questions concerning model comparison---chosing the 'best' model for a problem at hand---or dealing with the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability are central issues in many areas of empirical science, such as machine learning, computational sociology, or cognitive psychology, and most introductory textbooks dedicate some discussion to the topic [e.g. @Bishop2012_ModelbasedMachineLearning; @McElreath2020_StatisticalRethinkingBayesian]. For excellent discussions and examples of modeling in music research, see @Honing2006_ComputationalModelingMusica and @Finkensiepforthcoming_MusicTheoryModeldriven.

## Basic cultural inheritance mechanisms

Following this introduction, we introduce some minimal requirements to use Python for this course (@sec-python_primer). 

Subsequently, we introduce with six central mechanisms for cultural inheritance: unbiased transmission (@sec-unbiased_transmission), unbiased and biased mutation (@sec-unbiased_biased_mutation), directly biased transmission (@sec-direct-biased-transmission), frequency-dependent indirectly biased transmission (@sec-frequency-biased-transmission), and demonstrator-based indirectly biased transmission (@sec-demonstrator-biased-transmission). 
We follow up with a chapter on vertical and horizontal transmission (@sec-vertical), and finally introduce the multiple traits model (@sec-multiple-traits). The following diagram gives an overview of these processes:

  T --> BT(Biased)
  T --> UT(Unbiased)
  M --> BM(Biased)
  M --> UM(Unbiased)
  BT --> D(Direct)
  BT --> I(Indirect)
  I --> FD(Frequency-Dependent)
  I --> DB(Demonstrator-Based)
```

After having a firm grasp on how these processes can be modeled in Python
and how modeling results can be interpreted, we move to more advanced topics
(@sec-advanced), and more specifically into a number of recent exciting results about cultural evolution and music. We conclude our journey (@sec-conclusion) with a more general discussion of the implications of cultural evolution for how we think about music, on the relevance of modeling in music research and the humanities more generally, as well as on the great potential of this approach for future research.
