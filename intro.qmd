## The Cultural Evolution of Music

The field of cultural evolution emerged in the 1980's, 
and has, in parallel with the advancement of computational facilities,
gained momentum. In recent years, several approaches have attempted to 
apply formal models from cultural evolution to the domain of music [@Youngblood2021]. 

In the present context, we first introduce some central ideas of cultural evolution and review a few major publications for the domain of music.

### Central ideas

We start with six different mechanisms for cultural inheritance: unbiased transmission (Chapter X), unbiased and biased mutation (Chapter X), directly biased transmission (Chapter X), frequency-dependent indirectly biased transmission (Chapter X), and demonstrator-based indirectly biased transmission (Chapter X). Schematically, this is shown in the following diagram:

  T --> BT(Biased)
  T --> UT(Unbiased)
  M --> BM(Biased)
  M --> UM(Unbiased)
  BT --> D(Direct)
  BT --> I(Indirect)
  I --> FD(Frequency-Dependent)
  I --> DB(Demonstrator-Based)
```
