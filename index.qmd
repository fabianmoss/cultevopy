# Welcome {.unnumbered}

On these pages you will learn about cultural evolution and music.
The overall aim is to attain a basic understanding of formal models in cultural evolution and learn about several recent approaches that apply them to the domain of music.

We first summarize some general ideas about music and cultural evolution.
Subsequently, we follow an excellent learning path for computational models in cultural evolution by working through the book [_Individual-based models of cultural evolution_](https://acerbialberto.com/IBM-cultevo/) [@Acerbi2022]. Chapters X--Y comprise a translation of this resource to the Python language that we will use throughout. Finally, we will review and discuss a number of recent publications on music and cultural evolution in the advanced topics section.
